"The video essay is a love letter to Jenny Hval and her music. Music can connect me, and you, to a community where sound resonates between bodies. The narrator of the video is a music lover whose haunting voice is in and out of sync with the world's post-apocalyptic events. At the same time the narrator lives in the future and attends Jenny's gig with friends. This love letter is also secretly made for echolocating bats who are just as welcome in the audience as humans."

The video is a collaborative work between the author Aurora Ala-Hakula, artist Minna-Kaisa Kallinen, and Biitsi. We did the sound & music & voiceover (VO). Instead of a linear VO, we edited it into a fractured, ghost-like cloud of sounds. Heidi's dancing on the video, too, and Kaino filmed a few extra shots. 5/5 would do again.
