**2020**

A site-specific installation for [ANTI Festival](https://antifestival.com/en/tapahtuma/biitsi-fi-silver-medal/), Kuopio, November 2020. 

We also gave a course on art & sound for music students at the university of applied sciences. 'Silver Medal' is a collection of artworks made by artists and non-artists alike. The work revolves around health, class, family, and beauty.
