Biitsi has made a lot of music for choreographic works, performances, and installations. All the music we've performed in our live performances remains unpublished. 

Here are two remixes we've made, though:

[Feminine](https://open.spotify.com/album/43rHTC2R9NbJcrb33Kk43B), a remix of a Running instrumental track of the same name(2018)

[Shampanjahai kuivalla maalla](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ycGLH0m7LzYHaPjl6OJDO), a remix of Pyk√§ri's song "Shampanjahai", feat. Pyhims & Reino Nordin (2018)

Kaino also makes and performs music as [Kaino Kim Vieno](https://open.spotify.com/artist/04Vn6E0i9BOLKtz5vx5zES).
