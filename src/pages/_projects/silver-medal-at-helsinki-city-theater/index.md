We had the pleasure to present our theatrical installation "Silver Medal" as part of Helsinki City Theatre's [Stage for Contemporary Performance](https://hkt.fi/esitykset/nykyesityksen-nayttamo-2022-2023/) program, curated by Tuomas A. Laitinen, Suvi Tuominen, and Riikka Thitz. We used items and furniture from the Airbnb apartment that was rented for the work as props for displaying the objects made by our family members and fellow artists. Silver Medal mediates on the questions of skill, abilities, class, health, and taste.
