A series of works in which we ask questions about aging in capitalist societies.  Who has the energy to live a so-called third life; who will even make it? What does desire in old age look like? Whose aging are we talking about?

The original version, titled 'Hopeakulttuuri', was made for YLE (Finnish Broadcasting Company) in January, 2020. 

In March, 2020, a video version was created for an online event curated by [Shawné Michelain Holloway](https://www.shawnemichaelainholloway.com/) at DGTL FMNSM, Berlin.

An update was commissioned by Frame Finland in May, 2021, under the title 'Silver Epoch'. It features additional comments from curator [Gemma Medina Estupiñán](https://frame-finland.fi/en/programme/visitor-programme/gemma-medina-estupinan/) and a more accessible, plain English transcript by [Celia Brightwell](https://celiabrightwell.com/).
